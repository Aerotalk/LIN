            question: "Is there any registration or partnership fee?",

            question: "Can I continue my existing consulting work while being a partner?",
            answer: "Of course. That's the whole idea. You keep doing exactly what you're doing. Just add loan referrals when your clients need it. No time commitment, no exclusivity, nothing."

        {
            question: "Do I need prior experience in finance to become a partner?",
            answer: "Not needed. You don't process loans or handle approvals - we do all that. You just refer clients. We'll train you on our products and process. If you can talk to clients, you're qualified."
        },
        {
            question: "How will I receive my commission payments?",
            answer: "Direct bank transfer to your registered account. You get statements showing each referral and commission earned. Payments are regular and on time."
        },
        {
            question: "Is there a minimum number of referrals required?",
            answer: "No minimum. Refer when you have clients who need loans. Could be 1 per month or 10 per day. Totally depends on your business and client base. No pressure from our side."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I operate from any city in India as a LoanInNeed Consultant Partner?",
            answer: "Yes, anywhere in India. Metro, tier-2, tier-3 - doesn't matter. As long as you have clients who need loans, you can partner with us."
        },
        {
            question: "What types of clients can I refer?",
